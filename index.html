         <div class="column">Mental health effects are falling unequally across society, with people in some social groups bearing much more of the mental health burden than others. These effects are likely to deepen during the pandemic and its aftermath. But there is also cause for hope. While there is no vaccine for mental distress, much can be done to prevent mental health problems; well evidenced solutions are at hand.
            Worries and anxiety about COVID-19 and its impact can be overwhelming. Social distancing makes it even more challenging. Learn ways to cope during this pandemic.
            <strong>Recognize that your anxiety is completely normal,</strong> your anxiety is going to help you make the decisions that you need to be making right now – not spending time in big groups of people, washing your hands and not touching your face. Although anxiety about coronavirus is completely normal, make sure to get information from reliable sources or to check any information coming through less reliable channels
          <strong>Find new ways to connect with friends. </strong>  If you work remotely from home or you need to isolate yourself from others for a period of time due to COVID-19, avoid social isolation. Find time each day to make virtual connections by email, texts, phone or video chat. If you're working remotely from home, ask your co-workers how they're doing and share coping tips. Enjoy virtual socializing and talking to those in your home.
      <strong> Do something for others</strong> Find purpose in helping the people around you. Helping others is an excellent way to help ourselves. For example, email, text or call to check on your friends, family members and neighbors — especially those who are older. If you know someone who can't get out, ask if there's something needed, such as groceries or a prescription picked up.

   <h2>Good mental health is absolutely fundamental to overall health and well-being. </h2>
   <p>You can expect your current strong feelings to fade when the pandemic is over, but stress won't disappear from your life when the health crisis of COVID-19 ends. <br> Continue self-care practices to take care of your mental health and increase your ability to cope with life's ongoing challenges.
      Hoping mental health problems such as anxiety or depression will go away on their own can lead to worsening symptoms. If you have concerns or if you experience worsening of mental health symptoms, ask for help when you need it, and be upfront about how you're doing.

         <h3>Lockdown</h3>
         <p>COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measurements led to social isolation that affected severely the mental health of the general population all over the world, causing an increase in mental distress, depression and anxiety through the lockdown, sometimes associated with changes in feelings and lifestyle that include reduced physical activity, unhealthy eating habits, inadequate sleep quality and feeling of loneliness.

         <h3>Social distancing</h3>
         <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads easily through physical contact from person to person. This is why it is important to reduce the ways people come in close contact with one another. An effective way to do this is to stay home as much as possible and avoid crowded, public places where it is difficult to keep a safe space between people. When close interaction with others is likely, such as essential trips to the grocery store or gas station, the CDC recommends wearing a cloth face covering over your mouth and nose and staying at least 6 feet away from others.

         <h3>Vaccines</h3>
         <p>Vaccines to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are perhaps the best hope for ending the pandemic. COVID-19 vaccination will protect most people from getting sick with COVID-19. A small percentage of fully vaccinated people will still get COVID-19 if they are exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19. These are called vaccine breakthrough infections.
            If you are fully vaccinated, the overall risk of hospitalization and death due to COVID-19 is much lower than among unvaccinated people with similar risk factors.
